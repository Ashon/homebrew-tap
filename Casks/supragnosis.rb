# Desktop shell cask (signed + notarized universal .app zip from GitHub Releases - no DMG).
# Owns the plain `supragnosis` token: `brew install supragnosis` resolves here (no formula
# shares the name) and pulls the server formula via depends_on.
# Lives in the tap repo as Casks/supragnosis.rb; update-tap.sh rewrites version/sha256.
# The shell attaches to (or spawns) the daemon from the supragnosis-server formula found on
# PATH, so the app bundle carries no sidecar binary.
