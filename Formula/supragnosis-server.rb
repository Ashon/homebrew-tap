  # No `service do` block, deliberately. The always-on daemon has ONE manager - the canonical
  # LaunchAgent com.supragnosis.daemon, installed by `supragnosis service install` or the desktop
  # app's Start at Login (docs/daemon-lifecycle.md). A brew services job beside it is a second owner
  # of a single-writer store: it fails on the lock and KeepAlive retries it forever, unreported.
  # An existing brew services job keeps running after this upgrade; `supragnosis status` reports
  # it and `supragnosis service install --take-over` migrates it.
  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Run the daemon now and at every login (MCP on 127.0.0.1:7373 + the viewer socket):
        supragnosis service install
      or turn on Start at Login in the Supragnosis app (brew install --cask supragnosis).

      Coming from `brew services start supragnosis-server`:
        supragnosis service install --take-over

      After an upgrade, load the new binary into the running daemon:
        supragnosis restart

      Semantic retrieval needs the embedding model, fetched once (224 MB):
        supragnosis embed fetch
      The running daemon finds it within 30 seconds and embeds what it already holds;
      `supragnosis status` shows the progress.
