# supragnosis server/CLI formula (prebuilt release binaries; keyword + hashing search -

# release (version and sha256 filled in), so edit it here, never in the tap. Installs the plain
# `supragnosis` binary - only the brew token carries the -server suffix (the desktop-app cask owns
# the plain `supragnosis` token).

  # No `service do` block, deliberately. The always-on daemon has ONE manager - the canonical
  # LaunchAgent com.supragnosis.daemon, installed by `supragnosis service install` or the desktop
  # app's Start at Login (docs/daemon-lifecycle.md). A brew services job beside it is a second owner
  # of a single-writer store: it fails on the lock and KeepAlive retries it forever, unreported.
  # An existing brew services job keeps running after this upgrade; `supragnosis status` reports
  # it and `supragnosis service install --take-over` migrates it.

      Run the daemon now and at every login (MCP on 127.0.0.1:7373 + the viewer socket):
        supragnosis service install
      or turn on Start at Login in the Supragnosis app (brew install --cask supragnosis).

      Coming from `brew services start supragnosis-server`:
        supragnosis service install --take-over

      After an upgrade, load the new binary into the running daemon:
        supragnosis restart
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "supragnosis", shell_output("#{bin}/supragnosis --help")
